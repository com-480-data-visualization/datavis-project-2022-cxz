### Project Setup

There is no setup needed for our project, because we use the JS and CSS files directly from the website.

### Indended Usage

Users can learn about the energy information of European countries through intuitive and multi-dimensional visualizations. Specifically, users can learn about final energy consumption, renewable energy share and energy import/export status of each country in Europe.
